## Considerations 

1. USDC - upgradable on it's own, has block list.
2. All files in scope.
3. nSLOC/Complexity is 327.
4. Where is the LP interest coming from? Assume fees?


## Issues 

IThunderLoan not imported, also incorrect parameters

IFlashLoanReceiver.sol - why importing IThunderLoan? Bad engineering to edit code for tests. No NatSpec.
